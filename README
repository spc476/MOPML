                       My Own Private Markup Language
                                     or
                                    MOPML

  I came up with my own markup language to make writing blog posts easier
while still leaving the ability to drop down to HTML if I really need it. 
This isn't even close to being Markdown, Org mode or TeX, but a horrible
mishmash of the three, with my own custom addtions.  You are not expected to
understand, nor even use this, but hey, if you feel it's useful, go right
ahead.  But I won't accept any patches since this is for my own use.  Fork
away.  The only reason I have it publically available is that I do, on
occasion, reference this in online discussions and I would like to have some
place to point to when discussing my opinions on markup languages.

  You have been warned.

  Thank you and have a nice day.
